# **Mesto**

## Project Description

The "Mesto" project is an interactive web page that resembles a social network. It allows users to add an avatar, information about themselves, and create a gallery of images with the ability to like them.

## Implemented in JavaScript:
* Opening and closing modal windows.
* User data is saved and transmitted from the edit window on the page.
* The add cards window allows users to upload their own images.
* Cards can be viewed, liked, and deleted.
* Client-side validation of all forms has been implemented.
* Infrastructure environment created using Webpack.
* Interaction with the server is set up.
* On the page, both user-uploaded cards and cards received from the server (uploaded by other users) are displayed. It is possible to like all the cards, but only the user's own cards can be deleted.

## JavaScript technologies learned in the project:
* Basics of the Document Object Model (DOM), creating, adding, and removing elements.
* Data manipulation methods, conditions, loops.
* Arrays.
* Objects.
* Functions.
* Code modularity.
* Asynchronicity.
* Working with APIs.
